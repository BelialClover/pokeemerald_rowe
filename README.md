This branch adds music from the Generation IV Pokémon games to the Pokeemerald decompilations. It is recommended that your repository is up to date as long as this branch is too. Feel free to use the voice groups to make your own music.

This branch also implements Ipatix's HQ m4a mixer and *15 voice direct sound polyphony*. I also recommend keeping the sample rate the default value of 13379 Hz, as to prevent vanilla music from breaking.

Check out my other branches for music from select soundtracks:
* [**DPPt Music**](https://github.com/CyanSMP64/pokeemerald/tree/dppt_music). (Requires 1687104 bytes (~1.61 MB) of free space.)
* [**HGSS Music**.](https://github.com/CyanSMP64/pokeemerald/tree/hgss_music) (Requires 1439184 bytes (~1.37 MB) of free space.)
* **DPPt and HGSS Music**. (Requires 2895540 bytes (~2.76 MB) of free space.)

If you have space concerns and/or only wish to use select music from this branch, feel free to contact me on Discord at *@Furret#7777*.

Something else to note: Duplicate songs from FR/LG and Emerald have been removed. Click [here](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/blob/master/include/constants/songs.h#L401) to see which duplicate songs have been removed in case you have used a removed song in your own repository, in which case you should find and replace with the non-duplicate version.
